# Stack overflow users app

## Available Scripts

RUN

### `npm install` to install node modules.

RUN
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# `Material UI`

This application is using material ui library because of its customisation options that are easy to implement and create a better user experience.

# `INSTRUCTIONS`

Click on each user and the user card will expand and give you options to follow, unfollow and block user.

#`TIME CONSTRAINTS`
Due to time constraints I am using 2 sets of cards to display users. one to display when users are not filtered and another when users are filtered. This is also to show we can use 2 componemts based on the value of a variable.
